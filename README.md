This python scripts used for uploading multiple records to database.
here we work to upload more than 6000 records to product template in odoo.we generate simple script in python that's upload all files on simple click.
first it's read data on excel files and image directory and encode the image and through api we connected to postgresql.

This works on xml_rpc. XML-RPC service can call function(CRUD as well as ORM), its arguments, and the result of the call are transported using HTTP and encoded using XML.
XML-RPC is known as a web service. Web services are a set of tools that let one build distributed applications on top of existing web infrastructures. These applications use the Web as a kind of "transport layer" but don't offer a direct human interface via the browser.[1] Extensible Markup Language (XML) provides a vocabulary for describing Remote Procedure Calls (RPC), which is then transmitted between computers using the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP). Effectively, RPC gives developers a mechanism for defining interfaces that can be called over a network. These interfaces can be as simple as a single function call or as complex as a large API.
